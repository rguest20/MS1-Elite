        <h3>Combat</h3>
        <p>Combat in elite is relatively simple as long as you have your controls set up properly. Here are a few hints to help out for people new to the game:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Watch your throttle</strong>
            <p>Enemies will often zoom past you and as you turn to face them, they disappear past you again. At high throttles, your turning circle takes a hit and you lose some of your maneuverability. Throttle back or even reverse can suddenly
              place enemies front and center in your reticle.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Make sure you have the right tool for the job</strong>
            <p>In order to take down enemies you will usually have to drop their shield first before wearing down their hull integrity. Energy weapons take down shields better whilst physical shells will take down the hull more effectively. As long
              as you have both at your disposal, you can easily make short work of an enemy.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Early on, get help</strong>
            <p>It can be daunting taking on an enemy early on. There are a couple of options here. You can play with another player allowing them to help take down the enemy (although you may have to split the loot). You can also fight pirates in an
              area with system patrols. These will help take down your prey as well as providing other targets for them to shoot at. You are not alone, pilot!</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Two or three on one is not good odds</strong>
            <p>It is very easy to find yourself swamped in the game if you bite off more than you can chew. If you're going to take on multiple ships at once, make sure your ship is capable of taking some hits, because they will get some in on you
              whilst you focus on taking them down. </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Bounty scanners are worth it</strong>
            <p>As a bounty hunter, the benefits of a bounty scanner may seem obvious, but let me remind you to use it. Preferably before combat starts. It can improve your takings from a combat with a pirate quite considerably.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Repair, Repair, Repair</strong>
            <p>Repair bills early on are not too bad, but get very costly later on. You can get repair limpets or module repair components that will not only allow you to keep going longer between stops at a station, but also keep those bills down
              too!</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Finally, watch your shooting</strong>
            <p>If you're looking for a life of piracy (yarr), then don't worry quite so much about this. However, for everyone else, you probably don't want to anger the system patrols by shooting up their ships. They will also get upset if you start
              shooting at ships belonging to innocent bystanders. Make sure you shoot the right person by targetting first and waiting to see whether they are wanted. A good clue is that wanted pirates tend to scan your ship to see if you have any
              loot.</p>
