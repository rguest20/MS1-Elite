        <h1>Walkthrough</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Elite Dangerous. One of the first things you will notice is the large number of different menus that your ship comes with. In this section we will go through the different menus and what each of them do, so you can better access
          the
          universe Frontier have provided.</p>

  <section id="lefthandmenu">
    <div class="row">
      <div id="navmenu" class="col-12">
        <div id="menupic1" class="float-md-right">
          <img src="assets/pics/elitenavigation.jpg" alt="Navigation menu" id="navigationmenu">
          <p><small>Navigation Menu</small></p>
        </div>
        <h3>Navigation Menu</h3>
        <p>On the left we will find a navigation menu with 5 different tabs. These all have their own uses and we will go through each tab now.</p>
        <h5>Navigation</h5>
        <p>This tab informs us of what is in the solar system we are in. By clicking on any of these points we can set a waypoint to them. We also (if the ship is equipped with one) have the ability to set the frame shift drive to automatic. Early on
          this is a lifesaver and will prevent a lot of overshooting as you get used to the frame shift drive. Setting a nav point of another star allows us to jump to that star. This can also be achieved by going into the galaxy map and picking the
          star you'd like to jump to. Either way, activating frame shift once you have done this will get you to line up with the star and then go. This menu will be used a lot throughout your game play. Any mission critical locations will be
          highlighted in blue.</p>
        <h5>Transactions</h5>
        <p>This tab gives you information on currently active and complete missions. By selecting one of these you can quickly set your navigation to take you to either the next waypoint of your mission or where you need to go to complete. You can
          also cancel missions from this menu (this can incur a financial penalty, be aware).</p>
        <h5>Contacts</h5>
        <p>This tab tells you what nearby ships there are. This allows you to quickly lock on to them so that you can find them on your Heads Up Display. This is also the tab used to request docking at a space station. Again to do this, you need
          only click on the space station and click to request. If you have an auto docking ship component you will dock without any further input. Be aware that docking clearance will only be given once you are within 7500km of the space station.
        </p>
        <h5>Sub-targets</h5>
        <p>Combat only. This will allow you to select certain sections of enemy ships in order to be able to attack individual sections. This can be useful if you are looking to disable particular sections. For instance, attacking the cargo hatch
          will cause your target to leave his cargo behind. Can be nice if you know they're likely to run.</p>
        <h5>Inventory</h5>
        <p>This will only function correctly if you have the correct module, but will give you a list of the inventory being carried by your current target. This is useful if you wish to act as a pirate and get high value cargo, but is not super
          helpful otherwise.</p>
      </div>

  </section>
  <section id="righthandmenu">
    <div class="row">
      <div id="shipmenu" class="col-12">
        <div id="menupic2" class="float-md-right">
          <img src="assets/pics/eliteshipinfo.jpg" alt="Ship Information Menu" id="shipmenupic">
          <p><small>Ship Information</small></p>
        </div>
        <h3>Ship Info Menu</h3>
        <p>On the right we will find another menu with 5 different tabs. These are generally more informational and help you run the ship internals.</p>
        <h5>Status</h5>
        <p>The status menu gives you an overview of how your character is progressing in game. There you will find your various ranks (this is a good indication of what difficulty of mission you are prepared for) as well as your balance and what sort
          of penalty you can expect if your ship should explode. A lot of this is purely informational so to be perused during a long flight.</p>
        <h5>Modules</h5>
        <p>The modules that you have installed to the ship along with how damaged they are is to be found here. Generally, as long as a module is not destroyed it can be repaired through this menu by using module repair components. You may have a
          ship that is structurally sound but the modules are damaged beyond repair. These two things are tracked by the game separately. In the event you run into power issues, you can also disable certain modules to conserve power. Pro tip - don't
          turn off your life support!</p>
        <h5>Fire Groups</h5>
        <p>This menu allows you to set fire groups for your weapons and systems so that they can be mapped easily to a mouse/joystick. Make sure you set your fire groups after each new set of purchasing so you do not end up unable to join in a
          surprise combat.</p>
        <h5>Cargo</h5>
        <p>This menu allows you to see what is in your cargo hold as well as what you are trying to refine from ore. In order to refine from ore you need a refinery (and probably a mining laser). Generally a good idea to keep an eye on this as the
          more valuable your cargo is, the more likely you are to draw the attention of pirates.</p>
        <h5>Functions</h5>
        <p>Any additional functions your ship is able to undertake will be available from here.</p>
